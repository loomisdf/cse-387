/**

static class that supports working with the two uniform blocks shown below.

setUniformBlockForShader should be called for every shader program that includes
the uniform block below. This will create a buffers for each uniform block
and bind the buffers and uniform blocks together through the binding points.
Binding points for the two blocks and the associated buffers are defined above.

Adding a #include for this header file makes the functionality avaible through
the class name.
